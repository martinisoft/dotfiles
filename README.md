Aaron Kalin's Dotfiles
======================

These are my personal system configuration files.

Environment
-----------

I generally work off my Mac OSX 10.7 system, but lately have been working more and more off an Ubuntu 11.10 linux system. The configurations are slowly migrating over to be more agnostic between both systems.

Shell
-----

I am in the process of migrating over to zsh while maintaining some level of bash compatibility.
