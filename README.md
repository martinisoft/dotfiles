These are my personal system configuration files for things like my shell, editors, tooling, etc.

Environment
---

I generally work off my Mac OSX 10.12 system, but lately have been working more and more off an Ubuntu 14.04 and FreeBSD 11.1 system.

The configurations are slowly migrating over to be more agnostic between all systems and shells.

Shell
---

I am in the process of migrating over to fish while maintaining some level of bash compatibility for direnv.
