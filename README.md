# martinisoft's dotfiles

These are my personal system configuration files for things like my shell, editors, tooling, etc.

## Requirements

* [Homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick) or [Homeshick](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick)
* [Delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta)
* [McFly](https://github.com/cantino/mcfly)

## Environment

I generally work off my Mac OSX 10.15 system, but lately have been working more and more off an Ubuntu 20.04 and FreeBSD 12 system.

The configurations are slowly migrating over to be more agnostic between all systems and shells.

## Shell

My primary shell is [ZSH](https://www.zsh.org/) but I also fall back to [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

## License and Author

See LICENSE for details.
