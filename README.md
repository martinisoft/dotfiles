These are my personal system configuration files for things like my shell,
editors, tooling, etc.

How do I even?

This repository is a [homeshick](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick) castle.
You'll need to install homeshick (homesick also works too) in order to symlink
everything over.

Environment
---

I generally work off my Mac OSX 10.12 system, but lately have been working more
and more off an Ubuntu 14.04 and FreeBSD 11.1 system.

The configurations are slowly migrating over to be more agnostic between all
systems and shells.

Shell
---

I am in the process of migrating over to fish while maintaining some level of
bash compatibility for direnv.
